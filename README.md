# 3DCurvesSurfaces
All my 3D Curves and Surfaces Applications into one Unified Application

There are six sub-projects in this big project.

1. Parametric Cubic Curve
2. Coons Bicubic Surface
3. Bezier Curve
4. Bezier Surface
5. NURBS Curve
6. NURBS Surface

All of these are from my earlier projects, but this is a Unified Project, and also updated to the latest version of Three.js (Ver 125). This includes incorporating the changes where the erstwhile THREE.Geometry is deprecated and the new one THREE.BufferGeometry is introduced. 

You can work on this application at https://amarnaths0005.github.io/3DCurvesSurfaces/#two
